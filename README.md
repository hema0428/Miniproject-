TITLE : " TO PREDICT THE SALES  USING REGRESSION"

INTRODUCTION:
         The sale data mini-project shows the relationship between the 'Unit_Makingcost'  and  'Unit_Sellingprice' because the selling price depends upon the making cost to meet the profit. The  following content shows the possible outline:

OBJECTIVE:
         To analyze the relation between the unit makingcost,unit sellingprice,unit per profit and total profit using data visualization.

DATA COLLECTION:
       >>Gather the datas from the existing datasets(Secondary data)
       >>Filter required datas form that dataset.
                    << unit making cost 
                    << unit selling price
         >>Collect the variables for the data.

DATA ANALYSIS:
           >>Using the statistical methods such as regression to evaluate the relation between  making cost and selling price for per units
           >>Visualizing the datas as scatter plot,bar chart,pie chart etc.. to ilustrate the findings.

POSSIBLE FINDINGS:
            >>The selling price is associated with the the making cost .
            >>so, the  X Variable is making cost because its an in dependent variable.
            >>and, the Y Variable is selling price because it depends upon the X variable.

DASHBOARD VISUALIZATION:
     >>Bar chart
     >>Pie chart
     >>Tree map
     >>Geographic chart

CONCLUSION:
       The above mentioned data collection, data analysis, data visualization, regression are  done in this project.
